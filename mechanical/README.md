This part of the repo does contain mechanical file for Discovery. These files are generated using FreeCAD 0.18.1 (latest release from the community) FreeCAD is available on Linux, Windows and MacOS. It is free of charge.

You can download Freecad [here](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases).

You must install the __A2plus__ and __sheetmetal__ workbenches to be able to work on the model.

At the first level of the folder, you will find a file named __Discovery_asm.FCStd__, open it to access the full Assembly of the discovery.
The different parts are available in the __enclosure__ folder.
To make a change you have to modify the parts individually and then update them in the Assembly.
